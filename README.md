Here, I'm going to open a new ticket as Karen.

<p>
When opening a ticket, make sure that the end user fills out the information with the red asterik by it.
</p>
<br />

<p>
This is what the end user will see once the ticket is created.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

</p>
<p>
Now, I'm viewing the ticket as John Doe. I will be updating the Assigned To, SLA Plan, and Help Topic.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
I am updating the SLA Plan to Sev-A due to its severity.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Karen has set the help topic to Report a Problem. Here, I am updating it to its proper topic. 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
I am assigning the ticket to the Online Banking team.
</p>
<br />

<p>
When you refresh the page, you can see the thread on the ticket.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Working the Issue</h3>

<p>

</p>
<p>
Now, I'm signed in as Jane Doe to take a look at the ticket.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PWztyqE.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Ticket Lifecycle"/>
</p>
<p>
I'm reassigning the ticket to Jane (herself) since she is part of the Online Banking team.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Jane suspects that it has something to do with the recent update and plans to roll it back to see what happens.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
You can also see updates on the ticket from Jane's end.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Resolution</h3>

<p>

</p>
<p>
The problem did stem from the recent update as Jane rolled it back. Online banking is now up and running and Jane is waiting to hear back from the vendor.
</p>
<br />

To close the ticket, scroll back to the top and click on Status. Set the ticket to Resolved and close it.
